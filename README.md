# Time-Lock
A time lock smart contract would be a wallet that would keep your crypto assets locked for a certain amount of time. That means you won’t be able to withdraw your crypto assets even if you want to do so. We can use such wallets for multiple reasons. But one of the biggest applications of this time lock wallet is to prevent you from selling your crypto assets on the crash of the market. When the market crashes people tend to sell their crypto due to the fear of losing all their invested money. But we all know that if we want to make some really high profit in crypto we need to be able to hold it for a very long time. One way of doing this is to lock your crypto in a time lock wallet. In this way, you won’t be able to withdraw it for a certain amount of time.
